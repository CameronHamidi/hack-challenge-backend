Description: This app is the backend of an itinarary planning app that allows users to organize itinararies for trips. Trips are composed of days, and days are composed of events with various descriptive fields, so users can very clearly organize events by day and quickly refer to the itinarary and its details to know where to go/what to do next.
Requirements:
    Design an API with different routes: The project is indeed an API with various GET, POST, and DELETE routes
    Database modelling: Databases are modelled in SQLAlchemy
    Deploy to Google Cloud: The app is deployed to Google cloud
Anything else: The app is quite simple, but I had fun making it and really enjoyed the course.
